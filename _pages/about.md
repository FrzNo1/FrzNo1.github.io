I am a senior at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) majoring in [Computer Engineering](https://compeng.columbia.edu/). I am also a Teaching Assistant & Research Assistant at Columbia, and a part-time Software Engineer at [Siemens AG](https://www.siemens.com/).

At Siemens AG, I contribute to the Digital Industry Software Division(DISW), where I develop, design, and code for [NX](https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/nx/), a leading CAD tool utilized by major companies such as [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) and [Mercedes-Benz](https://www.mbusa.com/). My team, the Knowledge Industry Application (KIA) group, is based in California and is known for its excellence in innovation.

This semester, I am also a Teaching Assistant for [COMS W4118 Operating Systems I](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/teaching/w4118/) and a Research Assistant under Professor [Kostis Kaffes](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kkaffes/), focusing on GPU scheduling. Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant with Professors [Jeffrey Blanchard](https://blanchard.math.grinnell.edu/) and [Charlie Curtsinger](https://curtsinger.cs.grinnell.edu/) at [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu/). For more details on my research, please visit the Research section of my profile.
